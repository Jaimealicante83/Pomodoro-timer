Pomodoro web application designed by Jaime SÃ¡nchez Blanco

I have designed the web app focusing on mobile and tablet users.
I wanted to create a clean responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and it's easy to use in all devices.
I've used FlexBox to align the contents vertically and horizontally and to make the website responsive.
I've chosen SASS as CSS framework, I like it because it helps me to avoid repeating a lot of code and it makes the stylesheet very organized.
I designed a logo with Photoshop that also works as a link to index.html.
There is a burger menu icon that opens a menu with three links. The first one opens the settings page. The others open my portfolio and Infojobs profile as requested.
The play button becomes a pause button if you click on it.
Under the start session text it is the countdown timer. I've set it to 25.00 but you can modify it in the inputs.
The session length is 25 minutes by default and the break lenght is 5 minutes by default.
Both can be modified using the add/substract icons. I have added a little bit of functionality with JavaScript but only to show how should it work.
If you add or sustract time you will se how the countdown timer changes. 


 

TO DO LIST:

The layout is complete. 
I also added a little bit of JavaScript, to open and close the menu, but the code that I used to the application won't be very useful.
You can add and substract time in the session and break inputs but the app is not working.

Things to do:
1-The play and pause button should start and pause the countdown counter.
2-The restart icon should set the time selected by the user in the session length or break length input.
3-The time counter should show the seconds too.
4-When the countdown is over the counter should be set with the break time (5 minutes by default) and show a pop up that request
clicking the start icon to begin the break countdown. When the break time is over it should ask to start a new session (25 minutes by
default).
